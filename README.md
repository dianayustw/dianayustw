# 👋 Oh, hi! I’m Dian.
Currently on the last lap of my Informatics degree at UPN Veteran Jakarta 🚴‍♀️💨<br>
Deeply in love with data — from machine learning models to dashboards that (hopefully) spark joy and insight!

These days, you’ll find me:
- 📝 Wrapping up my thesis (a.k.a. my final boss battle)
- 🧪 Sharpening my skills through fun, hands-on dummy projects
- 🔍 Exploring exciting opportunities to gain real-world experience
  
Powered by trial, error, "aha!" moments, and just a bit of organized chaos 🌪️✨
